2. Binary Number in a Linked List

A binary number is represented as a series of 0's and 1's.
In this challenge, the series will be in the form of a singly-linked list.
Each node instance, a LinkedListNode, has a value, data, and a pointer to the next node, next.
Given a reference to the head of a singly-linked list, convert the binary number represented to a decimal number.

Example

Linked list corresponding to the binary number (010011)[2] or (19)[10].

Function Description

Complete the function getNumber in the editor below.
getNumber has the following parameter(s):
binary:  reference to the head of a singly-linked list of binary digits
Returns:
int: a (long integer)[10] representation of the binary number
Constraints 1 ≤ n ≤ 64 All LinkedListNode.data ∈ {01} The described (integer)[2] < 264

Input Format for Custom Testing

Input from stdin will be processed as follows and passed to the function.
The first line contains an integer n, the size of the linked list binary.
Each of the next n lines contains an integer LinkedListNode.data[i] where 0 ≤ i < n.

Sample Case 0 Sample Input

STDIN    Function
-----    -----
7 →  binary[] size n = 7 0 →  binary LinkedListNode.data = [0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0] 0

Explanation

The linked list is given as input.
The linked list forms the binary number 0011010 → (0011010)[2] = (26)[10]

Sample Case 1 Sample Input

STDIN    Function
-----    -----
10 →  binary[]
size n = 10 0     →  binary LinkedListNode.data = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1] 0
